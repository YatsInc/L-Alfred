**Voice assistant** that allows you to switch input languages by voice commands(**Windows only**).

## Currently supported for *switching*
All installed languages on your PC (*Exceptions may happen*).

2. Support of different voice recognition APIs
3. Offline usage
<!-- 4. UI to be able to set keywords and operate languages -->
<!-- 5. Support of Linux & MacOS -->
