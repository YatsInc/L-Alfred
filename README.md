# Language Alfred
**Voice assistant** that allows you to switch input languages by voice commands(**Windows only**).<br>
Perfectly fit for users that have **more than 2 input languages** on their PC and tired to press buttons every time to switch the new language.

# Supported languages
### Azure Speech To Text
Alfred can switch to any installed language on your PC (*Exceptions may happen*).

The list of languages that Alfred can *recognize* you can find [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/language-support?tabs=speechtotext#speech-to-text)<br>
**_Note. Default recognition language will be the same as your UI language on your PC._**

<!--# How to build & use it

Just run :)

<!--To be able to use it you have to create [Azure speech-to-text](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-to-text) instance in Azure Portal and paste credentials in User Secrets to match format provided below.

```
{
  "SubsribtionKey": "value",
  "Region": "value"
}
```-->

# **Roadmap: (*by priority*)**
1. UI to be able to change recognition APIs, set keywords and operate languages
2. Background mode (with Tray)
3. Posibility to run on startup
4. Support of different voice recognition APIs
5. Offline usage
6. ~~Support of Linux & MacOS~~
